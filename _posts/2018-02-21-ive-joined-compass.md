As many of you know, my past couple years in New York have had their ups and downs. After realizing my “dream job” wasn’t for me, I left the city to travel alone for six months, unsure of my next move and hoping to find answers. I was as surprised as anyone that this time abroad showed me how much I love this city, that I wanted to come back and stay, and that the change I needed was to move into a career with a balance of collaboration and independence.

Fast forward a few months and I had completed my NY Real Estate classes. I found myself interviewing at brokerages that I liked, but nothing that fit me perfectly. The second I walked into Compass I knew it was where I wanted to land, and I'm so excited to announce that I made it happen.

So now I'm back, and, as you may not know, an agent with Compass.

I've always been interested in Real Estate, but pressuring people into buying something is my nightmare, which left me hesitant. What I’ve come to understand, however, is that Real Estate isn't about sales -- it’s about relationships. I don’t sell a property; I find someone a home. Yes, this sounds cheesy, but for someone who travels so much I’m an aggressive nester. My home is my sanctuary, and I know how special it is to find that for yourself. As my relationships are so important to me, I’d love nothing more than to help someone I care about through the process.

And if you’re still concerned that I’m leaving the nonprofit realm, rest easy. I will always be an activist and advocate. In fact, I’m much more equipped to be these things after a day of work I enjoy.

Culture
The Joe + Kelly Team was not the first I met, but it was the first that inspired me. While many realtors stress the importance of innovation but push convention, Joe and Kelly spoke like the co-founders of a successful startup -- which they are. As they repeatedly drove home, the day you start in Real Estate you launch your own business, and they have become an example in the industry of how to establish and grow a brand by focusing on integrity and a deep devotion to clients.

It’s rare that I find two people so aligned with my values, even rarer that I get to work alongside them. I somehow convinced them to take a leap of faith, and I cannot stress enough how fortunate I am to be part of the Joe + Kelly family. Fun and energizing to be around, as well as incredible mentors, they also bring ten years of experience, meaning I can handle transactions from the jump that would normally be out of my league.

In short, I will be helping people buy, sell, and rent. Tenant-side, buy-side, listing-side, and rental-side, I’ll be doing it all. More specifically, I’ll be using my decade of experience in a variety of client service and support roles to take the stress out of what is typically a less-than-enjoyable experience. I’ll be hitting the ground running with a dedicated and experienced team behind me, so don’t hesitate to reach out or refer me simply because I’m new.

And I can promise you’ll never get mailers unless it’s a Christmas card of me with random animals.

New York Real Estate is in a league of its own, and it's increasingly clear that Compass is, too. Their commitment to their agents is unparalleled and has attracted the best in the industry. Their technology keeps improving, their marketing is spectacular, and there's unlimited free candy.

But it’s their mission statement -- to help everyone find their place in the world -- that hooked me. That's what attracted me to this industry: helping people through this process. Having spent so much time finding my own place in this world, it just made sense to start helping others find theirs.
